Ah! That error happens because you tried to **run the workflow file as a command**. `.yml` files are **not commands**, they are configuration files for GitHub Actions.

Here’s what you actually need to do:

---

### 1️⃣ Create the folder & file (do **not run it**)

In your S-Park project:

1. Open VS Code or File Explorer.
2. Create folders:

```
S-Park
 └─ .github
      └─ workflows
```

3. Inside `workflows`, create a file:

```
firebase-hosting.yml
```

---

### 2️⃣ Paste workflow content

Copy this into `firebase-hosting.yml`:

```yaml
name: Firebase Hosting CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build_and_deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build  # remove if not React

      - name: Deploy to Firebase Hosting
        uses: FirebaseExtended/action-hosting-deploy@v1
        with:
          repoToken: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
          firebaseServiceAccount: "${{ secrets.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT }}"
          channelId: live
          projectId: studio-9197727945-83c13
```

---

### 3️⃣ Add Firebase secret

1. In Firebase Console → **Project Settings → Service Accounts → Generate new private key** → download JSON.
2. In GitHub → repo → **Settings → Secrets → Actions → New repository secret**

   * Name: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
   * Paste the entire JSON content.

---

### 4️⃣ Commit & push the workflow

```bash
git add .github/workflows/firebase1-hosting.yml
git commit -m "Add Firebase Hosting workflow"
git push origin main
```

> This push will **trigger the workflow**, build your project, and deploy to Firebase.

---

After it finishes, your prototype will be live at:

```
https://studio-9197727945-83c13.web.app
https://studio-9197727945-83c13.firebaseapp.com
```

---

If you want, I can make a **ready-to-copy single block of commands** that creates the folder, adds workflow, sets up secret, and pushes everything so your prototype goes live immediately.

Do you want me to do that?
